# AutoGPT Interactive Shell Commands Plugin (Beta)

## <u>Overview</u>

This plugin allows Auto-GPT to execute interactive shell commands and get feedback from the user.


## <u>Commands</u>

1. ask_user => AutoGPT was hallucinating about an "ask_user" command, so I added one
2. execute_interactive_shell => Works like the inbuilt "execute_shell" commands, but supports interactivity
